This project entails the development and assessment of a prototype image search engine aimed at emulating the core functionalities of Google Image Search as it initially debuted. Comprising two principal components, the system encompasses image collection and indexing, followed by search and retrieval. Employing a Python web crawler, to scrape the Pexels website which provides free stock photos, the project retrieves image data focusing on specific categories like animals, places, sports, and more. Each image is annotated with alt text extracted from HTML content and ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network to enhance accessibility and search relevance. Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, textual surrogates of images are indexed, enabling efficient retrieval based on query relevance. The web-based interface facilitates user interaction, allowing queries and presenting relevant images based on search results. Through evaluation, the project aims to assess search engine quality based on query relevance, image diversity, and user satisfaction. This report documents the project's architecture, data collection, annotation, indexing, retrieval methods and evaluation, providing insights into future enhancements and research directions.
